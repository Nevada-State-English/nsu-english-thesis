For those who revel in remembrance, their favorite book might have made them feel nostalgic for something that once was. For those who seek out excitement, their favorite book might have made them feel a thrill unlike any other.

However, this depiction of the ideal adolescent romance often instills in young readers’ minds that violence—physical as well as verbal—within a relationship is a sign of adoration and devotion instead of the “red flag” warning of abuse that it really is. Like many other authors writing similar stories for young adults, Clare claims that her series is “feminist” because of its leading female characters, but the presence and justification of these abusive relationships implies more internalized misogyny than the author may have originally realized and makes these stories far less feminist than they claim to be. In this essay, I explore how this harmful depiction of romantic relationships and pseudo-feminism in The Mortal Instruments series warp young readers’, especially young girls’, concepts of what heterosexual love is meant to look like.",young adult; romance; love; trauma; Cassandra Clare; abuse; The Mortal Instruments; City of Bones,textual analysis,literary studies,Joanna Shearer,,,,,,application/pdf,,,,pdf,enght003.pdf,/objects/enght003.pdf,/objects/small/enght003_sm.jpg,/objects/thumbs/enght003_th.jpg,,

Yet, when retelling such chimeric stories to my hispanic relatives, such recollections are treated as facts of life. It is precisely this counter-intuitive merging between life and death, within Mexican culture, that this paper aims to capture. In order to explore this intimacy and attitude towards death, this paper uses the epitaph-like art form of the literary calaverita as a microcosm of Mexican identity. The literary calavera deliberately blends together: death, humor, spectacle, myth, mysticism, and the absurd in a surrealist scenario where death comes for our dear loved ones. In using the literary calavera as stand in for Mexican culture, this paper than conducts a comparative literature analysis through the usage of Chicano and Mexican literature such as Ana Castillo’s So Far From God, John Philip Santos, Places Left Unfinished at the Time of Creation, Octavio Paz’s The Labyrinth of Solitude, and Max Aub’s Mucha Muerte. Carlos Reygadas’ debut film Japón also plays a vital role developing this understanding.

For Self-Identified high achieving students, the reliance on grades for academic validation can be even worse. To separate grades from learning, many educators and scholars look towards going “gradeless” to remove grades as external motivational factors for doing well in school, as well as the inherent ranking of students that occurs with traditional grading practices. This essays questions just how much say grades have in determining a student’s writing confidence, and how ungrading can affect said writing confidence. The research performed suggests a notably strong link between grades and how students determine if they are good at writing. Research performed also suggested that students saw an increase in writing confidence when compared to traditional grading methods.

I argue that by using postcolonial and ecofeminist lenses to analyze and compare the allegorical character of Sycorax in these two texts, one is able to reexamine the way in which concepts of colonial violence, erasure of history, ecological exploitation, and appropriation of indigenous culture and heritage run through both Tempests. By comparing these texts, readers can gain an understanding of British colonial tactics to exploit the indigenous, as well as how it is challenged through postcolonial ecofeminist frameworks. Aimé Césaire, a major influencer in postcolonial discourse, critiques Shakespeare’s The Tempest through revisions that boost Sycorax’s character in his play, A Tempest. In so doing, Césaire uses Sycorax to challenge Prospero, a character that represents the colonial perpetrator. In short, postcolonial ecofeminism aims to expose the operations of dualistic thinking that oppress and exploit humans and nature through binaries such as culture over nature, reason over emotion, white over non-white, man over woman, and ultimately domination over subordination. By analyzing the allegorical character, Sycorax, this article shows the way in which Césaire challenges colonial and patriarchal tactics immortalized in Shakespeare’s The Tempest.",colonialism; William Shakespeare; The Tempest; Sycorax; Aimé Cesaire; A Tempest nature; women; motherhood,textual analysis,literary studies,Leila Pazargadi,Martinique; London,14.66120736,-61.03505856,,,application/pdf,,,,pdf,enght030.pdf,/objects/enght030.pdf,/objects/small/enght030_sm.jpg,/objects/thumbs/enght030_th.jpg,,
