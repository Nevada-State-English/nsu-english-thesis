However, this depiction of the ideal adolescent romance often instills in young readers’ minds that violence—physical as well as verbal—within a relationship is a sign of adoration and devotion instead of the “red flag” warning of abuse that it really is. Like many other authors writing similar stories for young adults, Clare claims that her series is “feminist” because of its leading female characters, but the presence and justification of these abusive relationships implies more internalized misogyny than the author may have originally realized and makes these stories far less feminist than they claim to be. In this essay, I explore how this harmful depiction of romantic relationships and pseudo-feminism in The Mortal Instruments series warp young readers’, especially young girls’, concepts of what heterosexual love is meant to look like.",young adult; romance; love; trauma; Cassandra Clare; abuse; The Mortal Instruments; City of Bones,textual analysis,literary studies,Joanna Shearer,,,,,,English,,,pdf,enght003.pdf,/objects/enght003.pdf,/objects/small/enght003_sm.jpg,/objects/thumbs/enght003_th.jpg,,

Yet, when retelling such chimeric stories to my hispanic relatives, such recollections are treated as facts of life. It is precisely this counter-intuitive merging between life and death, within Mexican culture, that this paper aims to capture. In order to explore this intimacy and attitude towards death, this paper uses the epitaph-like art form of the literary calaverita as a microcosm of Mexican identity. The literary calavera deliberately blends together: death, humor, spectacle, myth, mysticism, and the absurd in a surrealist scenario where death comes for our dear loved ones. In using the literary calavera as stand in for Mexican culture, this paper than conducts a comparative literature analysis through the usage of Chicano and Mexican literature such as Ana Castillo’s So Far From God, John Philip Santos, Places Left Unfinished at the Time of Creation, Octavio Paz’s The Labyrinth of Solitude, and Max Aub’s Mucha Muerte. Carlos Reygadas’ debut film Japón also plays a vital role developing this understanding.

For Self-Identified high achieving students, the reliance on grades for academic validation can be even worse. To separate grades from learning, many educators and scholars look towards going “gradeless” to remove grades as external motivational factors for doing well in school, as well as the inherent ranking of students that occurs with traditional grading practices. This essays questions just how much say grades have in determining a student’s writing confidence, and how ungrading can affect said writing confidence. The research performed suggests a notably strong link between grades and how students determine if they are good at writing. Research performed also suggested that students saw an increase in writing confidence when compared to traditional grading methods.

I argue that by using postcolonial and ecofeminist lenses to analyze and compare the allegorical character of Sycorax in these two texts, one is able to reexamine the way in which concepts of colonial violence, erasure of history, ecological exploitation, and appropriation of indigenous culture and heritage run through both Tempests. By comparing these texts, readers can gain an understanding of British colonial tactics to exploit the indigenous, as well as how it is challenged through postcolonial ecofeminist frameworks. Aimé Césaire, a major influencer in postcolonial discourse, critiques Shakespeare’s The Tempest through revisions that boost Sycorax’s character in his play, A Tempest. In so doing, Césaire uses Sycorax to challenge Prospero, a character that represents the colonial perpetrator. In short, postcolonial ecofeminism aims to expose the operations of dualistic thinking that oppress and exploit humans and nature through binaries such as culture over nature, reason over emotion, white over non-white, man over woman, and ultimately domination over subordination. By analyzing the allegorical character, Sycorax, this article shows the way in which Césaire challenges colonial and patriarchal tactics immortalized in Shakespeare’s The Tempest.",colonialism; William Shakespeare; The Tempest; Sycorax; Aimé Cesaire; A Tempest nature; women; motherhood; nature; ecocriticism,textual analysis,literary studies,Leila Pazargadi,Martinique; London,14.66120736,-61.03505856,,,English,,,pdf,enght030.pdf,/objects/enght030.pdf,/objects/small/enght030_sm.jpg,/objects/thumbs/enght030_th.jpg,,

"Cambell, Blakeli",enghtcambell.pdf,ht036,thesis,The Trees Will Free Me: Women Connect with Nature in Literature to Resist Male Dominance and Violence in the Patriarchy,2022-12,,,"Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to analyze how women are challenging the patriarchal issues prevalent in the man v nature literature genre by using nature in their writing to create a new feminist theme and genre of woman alongside nature. In using an ecofeminist lens, I argue the behavior seen in man controlling nature frequently in literature can be representative of the patriarchy and behavior women face when it comes to dominant men, as nature is often represented as mother nature. As this genre continues to be written and popularized, women writers are finding ways to input themselves in the nature genre by utilizing their connection with the earth in their literature, therefore changing the extractive relationship with nature into an alliance-based relationship with nature. Specifically for women in South Korea, where they may not be able to physically resist the patriarchy by marching for equal rights or fighting against men, women are turning to nature in their literature to resists these behaviors. This essay continues to then analyze how Korean fiction writer Kang Han and her novel The Vegetarian exemplify how women in restrictive countries like Korea can turn to their connection with nature in their literature to motivate themselves and resists the violence of male domination. Thus, showing women in restrictive countries that they can connect with nature not only to input themselves in a genre that often leaves them out, but also gives them an outlet of resistance by utilizing this connection to find control over themselves and their bodies. In doing so, The Vegetarian re-writes this masculine genre of writing and create a new feminist hero that challenges masculine violence, dominance, and the conquering of land and woman, representing women and inspiring them to gain control of their bodies and connect with their nature roots.",The Vegetarian; Han King; women; nature; ecocriticism; patriarchy; feminism,textual analysis,literary studies,Emily Hoover,South Korea,,,,,English,,,pdf,enghtcambell.pdf,/objects/enghtcambell.pdf,/objects/small/enghtcambell_sm.jpg,/objects/thumbs/enghtcambell_th.jpg,,

In loosely structured interviews with both students and tutors, three key themes were found as significant trends throughout the collective data. First, newer individuals exposed to interactions at the writing center disproportionately reinforce hierarchical norms. Second, verbal communication choices have the potential to be “overly nice” or act as a form of capitalist politeness, further obscuring systemic inequalities. Finally, body language materially encodes itself within cultural assumptions about authority and the physical space. By exposing how this power operates, this research argues for transformative tutoring practices that challenge the oppressive structures, center student agency, and reject performative practices of autho",writing center; tutoring; language; students; Marxism; Tara Yosso,qualitative research; interviews,writing studies,Brianne Taormina,Nevada State University Writing Center,35.98330936,-114.9392226,,,English,,,pdf,enghtdelrosario.pdf,/objects/enghtdelrosario.pdf,/objects/small/enghtdelrosario_sm.jpg,/objects/thumbs/enghtdelrosario_th.jpg,,

Johnson publishes Inner Lives: Voices of African American Women in Prison.,"Introduction: ""In 2010, author Piper Kerman introduced the world to her experience in a U.S. Federal woman’s prison, after being convicted of money laundering and drug trafficking. Her critically acclaimed text reached major audiences in 2013, once it became adapted into a television series of an abbreviated name, Orange is the New Black. Although her memoir made a point to highlight the stories of women of color that she encounters during her time in Federal Correctional Institution (FCI), Danbury, their stories were not the main focus of either her memoir or the show. They were seemingly only addressed to contribute to Kerman’s experience and to help appeal to a “wider” audience. This suppression of their stories are why the works of Paula C. Johnson’s Inner Lives: Voices of African American Women in Prison, along with Robin Levi and Ayelet Waldman’s Inside This Place, Not of It: Narratives from Women’s Prisons, are important to read and study. In their texts, the autobiographical protagonists discuss their daily lives while incarcerated, noting the inadequate healthcare, the physical and sexual abuse they endured from the correctional staff, and discrimination throughout the criminal justice system. . . .

"Joseph, Gabriella",enghtjoseph.pdf,ht039,thesis,The Gift of an Education: Agency in Women's Award-Winning Memoirs,2021-12,2018,Tara Westover publishes Educated: A Memoir.,"Abstract: This paper investigates memoir writing as a catalyst to future success and achievement as well as a documented literary artifact of one’s ambitious triumphs. In Malala Yousafzai’s debut memoir, I Am Malala, the author discusses the perpetually powerful ignition of her mind and how that led her to her quality education and second chance at life. Similarly, Tara Westover hails from her religious community and explores the agencies of poignant self-determination and authentic authorship in Educated. These women hold significance in their subjugations in that they tore down the walls of marginalization and an unattainable education as well as they created literature that shows valuable transcontinental change. Therefore, through a comparative close reading of the way in which Yousafzai and Westover defy the denial of education from their respective religious communities, this article argues that both women subvert expectations by firstly, pursuing their education and secondly, recording it in their life narratives of education. In writing about their experiences, both women exemplify how they use life writing to assert their agency through the dissemination of their stories, and encourage other women similarly oppressed by patriarchy. Despite facing multiple forms of liminality, they strongly disregarded the inaccessibility of their education and persevered. This ultimately led to their global success and achievement as articulate and capable women who continue to thrive instead of merely existing and remaining stagnant in an ever-changing world, all by inspiring others to create their own autobiographies.",memoir; autobiography; women; education; human rights; Malala Yousafzai; I Am Malala; Tara Westover; Educated; religion; Christian; Mormon,textual analysis,literary studies,Leila Pazargadi,Idaho,,,,,English,,,pdf,enghtjoseph.pdf,/objects/enghtjoseph.pdf,/objects/small/enghtjoseph_sm.jpg,/objects/thumbs/enghtjoseph_th.jpg,,

"Millard, Rebecca",enghtmillard.pdf,ht041,thesis,I Am Wonder Woman Hear Me Roar: A Feminist Analysis of Women from the Inception of Wonder Woman to the 21st Century,2017-05,1941,"Wonder Woman debuts in ""Sensation Comics #1.""","Chapter 1: Wonder Woman emerged onto the comic book scene in 1941. During her debut, patriarchy not only oppressed women in American society, it often silenced them in literature as well, and even with the advances made during the Suffrage Movement and the first wave of feminism, women in the 20th-Century were still expected to remain at home performing domestic duties. World War II gave women a unique opportunity to enter the workforce while men fought in the war; however, after the war was over, patriarchy began to force women back into domestic roles, trying once again to revoke their agency. Since then, Wonder Woman has remained an iconic feminist revolutionary, challenging gender roles and surpassing male prowess; yet, many contemporary feminist scholars question whether she is ever feminist enough, even in her debut. By exploring Wonder Woman’s role in comics through each wave of feminism, and by utilizing concepts found in Butler’s Gender Trouble: Feminism and the Subversion of Identity (1990) and Halberstam’s Female Masculinity (1998), I seek to show the myriad of ways in which themes of feminism, female masculinity, and gender performativity uncover how Wonder Woman has guided both pro- and anti-feminist readings over time. In so doing, it becomes evident that Wonder Woman must fulfill her role of empowering and guiding the gender perceptions of both young women and men to permanently extinguish the misogynistic standards of a patriarchal society which continues to silence women in the 21st century.",Wonder Woman; feminism; comics; gender; Judith Butler; Halberstam,textual analysis,literary studies,Joanna Shearer,,,,,,English,,,pdf,enghtmillard.pdf,/objects/enghtmillard.pdf,/objects/small/enghtmillard_sm.jpg,/objects/thumbs/enghtmillard_th.jpg,,

When a community stages this play, I hope it sparks meaningful conversations. I hope it encourages people to discuss their differences in a safe, open way, and, in doing so, discover that they have more in common than they thought. I also hope that when audiences leave the theater, they carry with them a commitment to prevent the injustices portrayed in the play in the real world.

My father comes from humble beginnings and is the fifth of nine children. He grew up very poor in a household with limited access to food and water. To put food on the table, my grandfather would take him and his brothers out to the fields to gather vegetables, move materials, or do whatever manual labor they could find. It was hard, back-breaking work, but it taught him to hold firm to the belief that he needed to do whatever was necessary as a provider because “tu familia es lo mas importante.” Like many men of his generation, this strict upbringing conditioned my father to endure no matter what challenges were placed before him. Unfortunately, when such high expectations are thrust upon the next generation, it creates a mindset in which they are often ill-equipped to navigate in the same ways and creates often unintentional emotional scars that are difficult to heal from. The children of such parents and grandparents hold on to their generational pain like a thorn rooted in their palm, where it festers and, if left untreated, cripples the limb. . . .""","Hector, Achilles, Homer, The Iliad, masculinity, fatherhood, trauma",textual analysis,literary studies,Joanna Shearer,Ancient Troy,,,,,English; Spanish,,,pdf,enghttorreslopez.pdf,/objects/enghttorreslopez.pdf,/objects/small/enghttorreslopez_sm.jpg,/objects/thumbs/enghttorreslopez_th.jpg,,
