## About This Collection

This is a collection of honors theses written by students in the Nevada State University English program from 2017 to the present day. The collection also includes photographs from students’ honors thesis defenses. You can download PDFs of the theses, or go directly to related thesis materials students made.

In the "explore" tab of this site, you can see different visualizations of information about these projects. You can explore a timeline of when the projects were developed, as well as locations that were central to students’ research. The "subject timeline" allows you to explore key dates of material that is researched in the corresponding thesis.

## What is an Honors Thesis?

An honors thesis is an in-depth research project for advanced English majors. Students may choose to complete a thesis directly in their primary area of study, or they may choose to develop a hybrid project. 

## Thesis Development Process

### Brainstorming
At least one semester prior to their enrollment in the Honors Thesis course (ENG 498), students begin the process of brainstorming the focus of their thesis. Some students choose to develop in more depth a project they’ve already worked on in another class; some students choose to begin a new project on something they haven’t had an opportunity to explore in another class setting. Students also select a primary project advisor during this stage.


### Proposal
Once students have selected a focus for their thesis, they develop a full proposal that addresses their topic, methodology, project exigence, provisional project timeline, and initial bibliography. They submit this proposal to their primary project advisor.

### Preparation
Some projects may require time beyond a single semester to develop and complete. Students may choose to complete an independent study prior to their Honors Thesis enrollment semester if this is the case. If a student’s research involves human subjects (interviews or surveys), then they complete an IRB application and certification prior to the semester in which they are enrolled in their thesis course (ENG 498). 


### Research and writing
Students officially enroll in the Honors Thesis course, ENG 498, during the semester in which they will be doing the bulk of their research and writing. They work weekly with their primary advisor to advance their project.


### Defense
At the end of the semester in which they are enrolled in the Honors Thesis course (ENG 498), students complete their theses by defending it to a committee of faculty mentors and experts. Students select their committee members to represent faculty who have helped shape their thinking as undergraduates and/or faculty who hold expertise on the subject of their research.
